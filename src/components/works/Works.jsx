            "This game is a worm-like 2D strategy shooter local multiplayer game! You must take account of the angle, power, and the wind each turn. Hitting crates in the air will give you a weapon upgrade. Each weapon upgrade will increase damage to the weapon and a few will act differently. There are three different weapon levels, starting out will give you weapon set level 1 to begin. (Please note, if you hit a crate, please switch to a different weapon at the start of the turn to start with that new weapon set level). Try unlocking the hidden weapon!! But also be careful welding all that power! When starting the game, youâ€™ll have a choice of how many turns (20+ and must be divisible by 2), how much time per match (5-10 seconds plus 3 seconds to pass the browser to your opponent), and how many players you want on the field (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4). Use the minimap to your advantage to see where your bullet lands and where are the crates in the sky!",
